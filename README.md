# Realtimeobjectdetection

Here, in this project we’ve considered around 60-80 objects to be detected . Some of those include ‘person’, ‘mug’, ‘train’, ‘bottle’, ‘sofa’, ‘dog’, ‘’cellphone’, ‘aero plane’, ‘bicycle’, ‘bus’, ‘motorbike’, etc. The output of this project displays the objects detected with a rectangular box around the object with a label indicating it’s name  which the object has been detected on the top of it. It can dig out any number of objects existing during a single image with certainty.
